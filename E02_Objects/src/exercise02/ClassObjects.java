		//    Make sure all data is private.
		//	  Consider which data can change during the "Lifetime" of the Person (hint: final fields can be initialised in a constructor)
		
		// 2. Add suitable methods such as toString() and eat() (eating makes you taller!) 
		//    Add suitable getXyz() and setXyz() methods
		//    Write code here to test these features of your Person class
		
		// 3. Add a constructor and test by coding: p= new Person( "Fred", 21, 5.8 );
		
		// 4. Enable one Person to be copied to another and test by coding: Person p2= new Person( p )
		//	  Check that p and p2 actually refer to two different objects
		
		// 5. Provide a suitable Person.equals() method and test it
		
		// 6. If time, create and display an array of Person objects
		
		// 7. If time, change the age field and getAge() method to something more suitable
		//    hint: research the Java8 API for LocalDate
